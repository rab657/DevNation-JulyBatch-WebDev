                    “Hello, I am SAMINA BUKHARI , and I will be completing my bachelor’s degree in COMPUTER SCIENCE from Virtual University in August. I have worked on a wide variety of projects 
                    that have allowed me to put what I’ve learned in the classroom into use in a practical sense. Last year, I was part of a new course where the students managed $500,000 and it was really exciting to see the portfolio grow.  I pride myself on being detail-oriented, analytical, and driven.  I understand that you are searching for a new investment advisor and 
                    I believe these qualities would benefit your company’s goal to increase your client base while continuing to provide sound investment advice.”
